custom-chat
================

A take on ChatGPT with some features that I have wanted for a while. Also testing out using Vite with PhET code.
See https://github.com/phetsims/phet-vite-demo.

### Quick Start

(1) Clone the repo:

```sh
TODO
```

(2) Install dev dependencies:

```sh
cd custom-chat
npm install
```

(3) Run it from a browser:

The following will run a server on your local machine, and you can navigate to the URL to see the demo.

```sh
npx vite serve
```

It will print out the URL to navigate to, e.g. http://localhost:5173/.

(4) Built it:

```sh
npx vite build
```

It will be built into the `dist` directory, where dist/index.html is the entry point. The dist directory can be
moved/served from wherever.

(5) Lint it:

```sh
npx eslint .
```
